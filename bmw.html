          The BMW i8 is a plug-in hybrid sports car developed by BMW. The i8 is
          part of BMW's electric fleet "Project i" being marketed as a new
          sub-brand, BMW i. The 2015 model year BMW i8 has a 7.1 kWh lithium-ion
          battery pack that delivers an all-electric range of 37 km (23 mi)
          under the New European Driving Cycle. Under the United States
          Environmental Protection Agency cycle, the range in EV mode is 24 km
          (15 mi) with a small amount of gasoline consumption. Its design is
          heavily influenced by the BMW M1 Homage concept car, which in turn
          pays homage to BMW's last production mid-engined sports car prior to
          the i8: the BMW M1. BMW will cease the production of the BMW i8 in
          April 2020.[10][11] The BMW i8 accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph)
          in 4.4 seconds[12][13] and has an electronic limited top speed of 250
          km/h (155 mph). The BMW i8 has a fuel efficiency of 2.1 L/100 km
          (134.5 mpg‑imp; 112.0 mpg‑US) under the NEDC test with carbon
          emissions of 49 g/km. The EPA rated the i8 combined fuel economy at 76
          MPGe (3.1 L gasoline equivalent/100 km; 91 mpg-imp gasoline
          equivalent) and 29 miles per gallon (6.7L/100 km) when running in pure
          gasoline mode (after the battery is drained empty). The initial
          turbodiesel concept car was unveiled at the 2009 International Motor
          Show Germany. The production version of the BMW i8 was unveiled at the
          2013 Frankfurt Motor Show. The i8 was released in Germany in June
          2014.[14] Deliveries to retail customers in the U.S. began in August
          2014. By early November 2016 global sales since mid-2014 totaled more
          than 10,000 BMW i8s, making the i8 the world's top selling plug-in
          electrified sports car. The top selling markets are the United States,
          the United Kingdom, Germany, China and Canada.
