        <p class="lead">
          The Mercedes-Benz S-Class, formerly known as Sonderklasse (German for
          "special class", abbreviated as "S-Klasse"), is a series of full-size
          luxury sedans and limousines produced by the German automaker
          Mercedes-Benz, a division of German company Daimler AG. The S-Class
          designation for top-of-the-line Mercedes-Benz models was officially
          introduced in 1972 with the W116, and has remained in use ever since.
          The S-Class has debuted many of the company's latest innovations,
          including drivetrain technologies, interior features, and safety
          systems (such as the first seatbelt pretensioners).[5] The S-Class has
          ranked as the world's best-selling luxury sedan,[6] and its latest
          generation, the W222 S-Class, premiered in 2013. As in previous
          iterations, the W222 S-Class is sold in standard and long-wheelbase
          versions; I4, V6, V8, V12, diesel and hybrid powertrains are offered.
          All models built in Mexico or sold in the United States are available
          in long wheelbase only. In automotive terms, Sonderklasse refers to "a
          specially outfitted car." Although used colloquially for
          decades,[citation needed] following its official application in 1972,
          six generations of officially named S-Klasse sedans have been
          produced. Previous two-door coupe models of the S-Class were known as
          SEC and later S-Coupe. In 1996 the S-Class coupe was spun off in a
          separate line as the CL-Class, however as of June 2014, it has been
          re-designated as the S-Class Coup√© for the 2015 model year, doing away
          with the CL-Class. In 2016, the S-Class Cabriolet, internally named
          A217, was introduced with three variants: the S 550 Cabriolet, the
          Mercedes-AMG S 63 Cabriolet with 4Matic, and the Mercedes-AMG S 65
          Cabriolet.[7] The Mercedes-Maybach S 650 Cabriolet, based on the S 65
          Cabriolet, was announced in 2016.[8]
