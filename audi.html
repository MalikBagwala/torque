        <p class="lead">
          The Audi R8 is a mid-engine, 2-seater sports car, which uses Audi's
          trademark quattro permanent all-wheel drive system. It was introduced
          by the German car manufacturer Audi AG in 2006. The car is exclusively
          designed, developed, and manufactured by Audi AG's private subsidiary
          company manufacturing high performance automotive parts, Audi Sport
          GmbH (formerly quattro GmbH), and is based on the Lamborghini Gallardo
          and presently the Huracán platform. The fundamental construction of
          the R8 is based on the Audi Space Frame, and uses an aluminium
          monocoque which is built using space frame principles. The car is
          built by Audi Sport GmbH in a newly renovated factory at Audi's
          'aluminium site' at Neckarsulm in Germany. It is also the first
          production car with full-LED headlamps.
        </p>

          The Motorsport variants of the R8 were also subsequently introduced
          from 2008 onwards. An all-electric version called the e-Tron started
          development but would only reach production stage when the second
          generation model would be introduced.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          In 2018, the R8 received a mid-cycle refresh with mechanical and
          exterior changes. The newer and more aggressive design language
          carried over from famous Audi models of the past. Some of the
          aerodynamic features such as the front aeroblades are shared with the
          Lamborghini Huracàn. The refreshed model had substantial performance
          improvements over its predecessor.
